# TV-Halftime-Shows-and-the-Big-Game
This was the first full project I made during "Data Scientist with Python" study on DataCamp.

Python Prerequisites: Intermediate Python

Topics:

Data Manipulation
Data Visualization
Importing & Cleaning Data

Project Description:

In this project's guided variant, you will look at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows.

Questions like:

-What are the most extreme game outcomes?

-How does the game affect television viewership?

-How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?

-Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

-The dataset used in this project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.

Project Tasks:

-TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game

-Taking note of dataset issues

-Combined points distribution

-Point difference distribution

-Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?

-Viewership and the ad industry over time

-Halftime shows weren't always this great

-Who has the most halftime show appearances?

-Who performed the most songs in a halftime show?

-Conclusion

(Tasks were created by David Venturi, Data Science Educator.)
